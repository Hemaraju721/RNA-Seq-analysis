RNA-Seq analysis and ncRNAs
This is a pipeline for RNA-Seq dataset. Pipeline to identify gene expression across samples and then to further categorize them into different categories of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Three important categories of ncRNAs - lncRNAs, pseudogenes and antisense RNA(asRNA) are further analyzed to detect their respective putative targets (protein coding genes).
